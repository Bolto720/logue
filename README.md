# Logue

The start of a true roguelike, written in the Rust programming language.  You can move, attack, gather items... but that's about it at the moment.

Try it at http://knight-net.co.uk/logue.html which is a WASM compiled version.

Use the arrow keys to move, g to collect an item and i to show your inventory.
